This is more personal development project, than open source. But it is open and if you want, do with it everything you want.

To start you must make "logs" dir and start pygame_engine.py with params like this:
ALL . 1000 1000 "python old/MyBot.py"
To test bot written in my_bots.py (MyBot6 currently) on all maps with my old raw bot in old/MyBot.py

Also you need to have pygame installed.
